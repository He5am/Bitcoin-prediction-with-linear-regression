### Bitcoin price prediction simulation
## Introduction :
In this project, I tried to design a laboratory model using basic knowledge about machine learning algorithms that can predict the daily price of Bitcoin with a good percentage in laboratory conditions.
## Checking the route and solution:
To achieve this purpose, I used the linear regression algorithm.
I started to learn.
To predict, I needed the daily information of Bitcoin price from the site
coinmarketcap I downloaded the daily price of Bitcoin in the last year in csv file format and checked it.
At first, I checked the data a little with charts and finally found a linear relationship between close and other variables.
To further investigate, I drew diagrams and created a model.
The first model predicts based on open, which has good accuracy.
To check the price of the day, I used the api of the mentioned site and showed the predicted price; But I noticed that the second model that predicts with MarketCap provides better results in most cases.
## Result :
This is an exercise project for working with linear regression, which naturally cannot be used in real environments and cannot be relied upon; this is a laboratory model and since it is made with a simple linear regression, prices are always set as It predicts an increase.
